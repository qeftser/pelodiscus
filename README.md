# Expert Systems Shell

Simple expert systems shell written in clojure that uses conditions to
determine the correct action to take. Fuzzy sets are used to compute truth
values and degrees of relation to certain conditions.

## Why the name?

Pelodiscus is a sub-species of soft shell turtles. The soft shell turtle
has (you guessed it) a soft shell, so I thought it was a fitting namesake
for this project.
